useful arthropods housing," Insect houses (ConceptID: <http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_209450>)

Here is how I arrived at this conclusion:

The given entity ""useful arthropods housing"" can be classified under the broader category of ""Habitats"", which falls under the superior concept ""Biodiversity"". However, since we are specifically looking for a subconcept within ""<http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_3678>"", which refers to ""Invertebrates as resource"", we need to find a more specific subcategory within that concept.

One relevant subconcept of ""<http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_3678>"" is ""Useful invertebrates"" (<http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_312464>), and under this subconcept lies another relevant subconcept called ""Beneficial insects"" (<http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_229391>). Arthropods belong to the phylum Arthropoda, which includes various groups like insects, spiders, scorpions, crustaceans, etc., many of which have beneficial roles in agriculture. Therefore, it makes sense to consider ""Beneficial insects"" as a possible candidate for our entity.

Under the ""Beneficial insects"" subconcept, there exists an even more specific subconcept called ""Insect houses"" (<http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_209450>). This term encompasses structures designed to provide shelter and breeding sites for insects, including those considered useful arthropods such as pollinators and natural enemies of pests. Thus, ""Insect houses"" seems to be the most suitable AgroVoc narrower for ""useful arthropods housing"".",17.196736097335815
